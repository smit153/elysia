          The Slug That Inspired It All
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Elysia chlorotica is a unique species of sea slug that can perform{" "}
          <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, absorbing energy from the sun like a
          plant. By incorporating chloroplasts from the algae it eats into its
          own cells, it becomes <strong>self-sustaining</strong> and requires
          less food to survive. This incredible ability mirrors our own journey
          - by being mindful of what we consume, we empower ourselves to thrive.

            The Vision Behind Elysia
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Cooking is more than just a necessity—it&apos;s a way to nourish
            both body and mind. Our vision is to build a platform where people
            can explore diverse recipes, develop new skills, and gradually
            become more self-reliant in the kitchen. Just like Elysia chlorotica
            adapts and grows by integrating the best of what it consumes, this
            app allows food lovers to nurture, discover, and evolve their
            culinary environment.
